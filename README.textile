h2. How to Use

As per the flickr_fu instructions, place a file called flickr.yml in the config directory that contains the following information:
<pre><code>
  key: abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc123abc #your api key
  secret: abc123abc123abc #your secret key
</code></pre>

In order to pull the desired photos from your Flickr account, route to this uri:<code>/photos</code>

In order to show a gallery of tagged photos, route to this uri: <code>/photos/:tag</code> where the tag param is the tag you with to show.

You can also use setnames instead of tags if you wish.  Just look through the code and you'll see how to accomplish this.
